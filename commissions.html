        <p id="text1"> My Commissions won't cost as much as most peoples as I'm not the best at drawing so don't expect a masterpiece.</p>
        <p id="text2"> I will take a long time drawing especially if requested a digital art piece. I don't do backgrounds yet but maybe in the future I will.</p>

        <br><br>

        <p id="text5">Another example of my traditinal drawing of mine but it is in a (realistic) style. This will be more expensive as it would take a lot more time for me to do.the person in the drawing is Pennyunderbust.</p>

        <br><br><br>

        <img style="width: 300px; height: auto;" src="images/Scarlet.png" alt="A redrawing of Pennyunderbust but this time it is a digital drawing where I drew her with a dark purple sweater and a purple skirt. There is no background here.">

        <br> <br>

        <p id="text6">A digital example of the realistic drawing I'm really new to digital art so it will take me a while to get better at it and to draw it especially with the lack of good technology.</p>

        <p id="text7">I will also create skyrim characters for a low cost. So please ask. The characters will be in a low quality as my computer is a lower functioning one but I have plenty of mods so if you want anything specific just ask. If you want a scene then that'll be a few extra dollars.</p>
